# System Management Scripts

## Overview

This project includes two scripts for basic system management tasks: one written in Python and another in Bash (Shell). Both scripts provide functionalities for directory and file operations, process monitoring, and system interaction.

## Python Script

The Python script offers the following features:

1. **Create Directory**: Create a new directory.
2. **Create File**: Create a file and write a personalized message to it.
3. **Ping Test**: Perform a network ping test to a specified host.
4. **Display Processes**: Show ongoing processes using the `top` command.

### How to Run

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script using Python 3.x.

   ```bash
   python python_script.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**: The script will prompt you for your name and offer a menu of options:
   - **1. Make Directory**: Enter the name of the directory to create.
   - **2. Make File**: Enter the name of the file to create.
   - **3. Ping Test**: Enter the host to ping.
   - **4. Display Processes**: Show ongoing processes.

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter your name: John
Welcome to our world, HI John
1. Make Directory
2. Make File
3. Ping Test
4. Display Processes
5. Exit
Enter the option: 1
Enter directory name: test_dir
test_dir created successfully
```

## Shell Script

The Shell script provides similar functionalities with additional options for removing directories and files, and viewing process information with `htop` and `tree`.

### How to Run

1. **Make the Script Executable**: 

   ```bash
   chmod +x shell_script.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   ./shell_script.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**: The script will prompt for your name and offer a menu of options:
   - **1. Make Directory**: Enter the name of the directory to create.
   - **2. Make File**: Enter the name of the file to create.
   - **3. Remove Directory and File**: Enter the names of the directory and file to remove.
   - **4. `htop`**: Display ongoing processes using `htop`.
   - **5. `tree`**: Display directory structure using `tree`.
   - **6. Exit**: Exit the script.

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter your name:
John
Welcome user, John
1. Make Directory
2. Make File
3. Remove Directory and File
4. htop
5. tree
6. Exit
Enter option: 1
Enter directory name:
test_dir
Directory created successfully
```

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**: Required for the Python script.
- **Bash Shell**: Required for the Shell script.
- **htop** and **tree**: Should be installed for Shell script functionality.
